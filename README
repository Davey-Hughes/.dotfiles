OH-MY-ZSH

USAGE
    You must first have ZSH installed; installation and instructions here:
        https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

    The easiest way to keep your themes and .zshrc up to date with this
    repository is to symlink the files from this submodule into the locations
    they belong. For example:

    cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/omz-davey && ln -s ./zshrc ~

PROMPT
    ZSH has support for four main prompts and a rear prompt, titled:

        PROMPT
        PS2
        PS3
        PS4
        RPROMPT (for rear prompt)

    Only PROMPT, PS2, and RPROMPT are used for this theme. Here is what each
    prompt contains, from left to right:

        PROMPT <first line>
            - current directory (with user's home replaced with ~)
            - <git> repo status; a * denotes uncommitted changes
            - user
            - host
            - tty
        PROMPT <second line>
            - shell evaluation depth (id est, starting zsh as a child process of
              zsh will create a depth of 2)
            - number of children
            - history event number
        PS2 <secondary input>
            - status of the parser, such as if shell constructs (like 'if' and
              'for') have been started
        RPROMPT <rear prompt>
            - return status of last program
            - time of day in 24hour 4 digit format
            - month, day, and year

    The prompt will also detect a few other conditions and change the colors and
    characters slightly:
        SSH
            - color of host changes to red
        ROOT
            - square brackets change to #
            - user, #, and outline characters change to red
        SHELL DEPTH
            - if the shell depth is greater than 1, color changes to yellow
        BACKGROUND PROCESSES
            - if there is more than 0 children in the background, color changes
              to yellow

NOTES
    The original font used in designing this is Consolas, however most monospace
    fonts with decent unicode support will work.

    Though the RPROMPT is built into ZSH to align left (and disappears if the
    prompt input extends to the right edge of the screen), getting a two line
    PROMPT requires calculating the width of the console and subtracting the
    spaces and subtracting the width of the other elements on the first line.
    This process was adopted from phil!'s prompt, documented here:
        http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/

    Originally based on bira, gnzh, phil!'s, and nanotech themes
